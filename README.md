# Serenity (AI Generated Music)
A simple AI transformer model that was trained using piano renditions of pop and soft rock music. The goal of this project was to experiment with leveraging 
generative AI and transformer networks to create human sounding music. The dataset contains 152,000+ songs in total, including synthetically generated samples, 
and the network weighs in at about 24M parameters.
